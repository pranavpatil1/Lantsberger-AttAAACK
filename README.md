# Lantsberger-AttAAACK

This project was developed by a team of 4 AP Computer Science students a 2 3D Animation students for the AP Computer Science A final project.

The game is an amalgamation of various aspects of Mr. Lantsberger's (Teacher of the Year!) class in a game that aims to help students review important AP Computer Science topics. 

In this platformer, the player jumps around from platform to platform trying to defeat the enemies. The player can get powerups for new types of powers by answers computer science questions. 

Notable features:
 - PHYSICS ENGINE: The physics were created from scratch (gravity/collisions)
 - INTELLIGENT ENEMIES: The enemies are controlled by an "AI" where they intelligently run on platforms and can jump to other platforms even with varying speeds and abilities.
 - COLLABORATION: By collaborating in a team with varying strengths, a very complete game with hand-drawn or original images created and music.
 - JAVAFX: Graphics are drawing images on a canvas and translating based on camera position.
